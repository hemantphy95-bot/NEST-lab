<h3>High Entropy Alloys (HEAs)</h3>
<p>
High Entropy Alloys are multi-component systems designed to enhance configurational entropy and structural stability.
Our work focuses on defect engineering, irradiation tolerance, and catalytic behavior.
We study phase evolution using XRD and TEM techniques.
Mechanical stability under extreme conditions is a major objective.
We investigate corrosion resistance and surface reconstruction.
Advanced modelling is used to correlate entropy with phase stability.
Thin film HEAs are fabricated for energy applications.
Ion beam modification is employed for microstructural tuning.
Electrocatalytic performance is tested systematically.
HEAs provide promising routes for sustainable energy technologies.
